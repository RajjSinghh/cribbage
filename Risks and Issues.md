## Risks and Issues

### Communication Issues:

1. The group members come from different cultural backgrounds, which may cause disagreements
2. Poor communication with customers
3. The progress will be complicated later than expected
4. In the middle of development, it was discovered that there were errors in the basic items that were originally confirmed from the beginning, which caused the entire project to be overthrown and restarted.

### Technical issues:

5. The expected functions cannot fully/partially meet the expected requirements
6. The program cannot cope with emergencies
7. The program cannot cope with the consequences of human operations, such as administrator errors, etc.

| Number | Priority | Loss | Prabability |
| ---- | ----   | ---- | ---- |
| 1    | High   | It at least delays the delivery, or even fails the project. | High probability, but will not lead to the worst in general. |
| 2    | Medium | This will lead to errors between expectations and the project, and untimely communication may waste time and effort. | Medium probability. |
| 3    | Medium | Reduce the customer's rating of the project team, and disrupt the global plan. | High probability |
| 4    | Medium | It takes a lot of time and energy to correct the direction of the project. | Low probability |
| 5 | Low | The completion of the project does not meet customer requirements. | Medium probability |
| 6 | Low | The project cannot complete the task requirements under any circumstances. | Low probability |
| 7 | Low | The project may collapse under human intervention. | Medium probability |

 ### Cope with the risk

1. Establish communication channels (via Github, Whats app, etc.) to clarify the work that each team member needs to do and the deadline for completion. Timely discover and mediate disputes and disagreements within the team.
2. By appointing the person in charge to contact the customer regularly (via e-mail, Trello, etc.) to ensure that the development of the project meets the requirements of the customer's expectations.
3. Develop an effective time schedule (note that, leave a certain buffer space for each item that needs to be processed or completed) and change the time schedule accordingly when the time, technology, personnel, and other conditions change.
4. It is necessary to clarify the purpose and development route in a timely manner in the early stage of the project, and maintain a smooth communication route with customers and instructors.
5. Communicate with the customer clearly to disambiguate, understand what needs to be changed or added, and then take remedial measures afterwards.
6. By adding tests that simulate on-line running to verify the actual running results and simulate various unexpected scenarios for the project to verify the robustness. And need to do a considerable degree of research on the environment of customer needs.
7. Ask the customer about the docking environment, and simulate the modification of the data under the administrator operation scenario, and limit certain administrator and user permissions based on the simulation results.

  Various situations that may arise in the test should be taken into consideration in the establishment of the project
