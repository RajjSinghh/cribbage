# 3. Project Development (20% - Max 2 Pages)

## 3.1 Development Approach

The development approach we have chosen to use is scrum development. The decision to go for an
agile approach to development was made to reflect the changes that can happen at different points throughout the 
project, like the COVID-19 situation affecting how people will move around the hospital or the DRI requesting more
features further down the line. The workflow will involve our teammates being assigned a job to work on for the week
and the team will meet at least once a week in the assigned practical session to discuss progress and move people
around to different tasks where appropriate. This prorgress will be recorded on a Trello board and in our GitHub 
repository and meetings with the client will be arranged to discuss progress or changes. We can keep this workflow 
for the whole project.  

This workflow is useful for a few reasons. The first is that it gives us flexibility to accomodate features 
and changing requirements in the future, as well as giving us time to work around full student schedules. This 
development approach is also much more suitable than the Waterfall approach since we know that parts of the project
are subject to change, so a full waterfall approach where we analyse, design, code and test will take a long time and
changing requirements will hurt our development and lead to wasted time.
