1.1 – Overview and Justification 
Despite significant AI progress, its pace and direction are largely unassessed and hard to extrapolate. In this project, an intelligent map was created to help users reach their chosen destination in the DRI building using audio and visual effects. The AI audio designed helps the users communicate with the web app map to specify their destination based on their needs, where the audio is taken as the input and the output is the directions given by A* graph algorithm, which is an informed search algorithm that is formulated in terms of weighted graphs meaning it has the smallest cost. Moreover, the visual effects were implemented so that the user can visualise his journey and drop the pin on the room he is heading to with audio assistance for directions. In addition, the intelligent map is easily updatable while functioning (direction features) through storing the graph data in a database and updating it with SQL including creating, removing, and renaming buildings, where the admin only accesses it and gets the new data with an HTML form. The whole purpose of this project is to help onsite visitors navigate through the building such as getting from point A to point B in the map. Thus, benefitting new visitors, urgent cases, and handicapped people in moving around efficiently.
